# Perfect Cell

After years of tireless effort, two scientists have weaponized an autonomous cell. The cell does not think it only consumes as it does so it grows exponentially bigger. Don't worry, it can't breach its container.

Note: This game was built using Godot 4, which requires the Experimental SharedArrayBuffer, which may cause the game to not work in all browsers

### Controls:

WASD - Move Character

### How to Play:

Control the cell and consume other organic material to grow bigger
